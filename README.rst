This package lets you use the `pycountry database
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycountry/>`_ within Zope 3.


In practice, this means e.g., that you can easily get a zope.schema.Choice
field to provide a full list of iso 3166 country codes.

For more information about the database please refer to the
`pycountry product <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycountry/>`_.
